# First Steps in Docker and first Spring Boot Microservice in Docker

## Aim of this Project
This project is to deliver a tutorial to teach the reader how to create Docker containers

Some of the containers deliver simple C++ projects as Docker containers 
other project deliver Java projects as Docker containers (Including a simple Springboot project)

There is also a chapter on docker commands even a chapter on Portainer for managing Docker instances and Kubernetes clusters
 
The reader is provided with a Tutorial as a PDF document and folders of most the projects as examples

## Examples of the Code for excercizes in this tutorial:

The first Docker container : [hello-cpp0](https://github.com/nic0michael/First-Steps-in-Docker-and-first-Spring-Boot-Microservice-in-Docker/tree/master/hello-cpp0)

The first Java Docker container: [hello-java](https://github.com/nic0michael/First-Steps-in-Docker-and-first-Spring-Boot-Microservice-in-Docker/tree/master/hello-java)
